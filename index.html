			<h2>0.1 WHAT IS OPEN SOURCE?</h2>
			<p>Open source is source code that is made freely available for possible modification and redistribution. 
			Products include permission to use the source code, design documents, or content of the product. 
			The open-source model is a decentralized software development model that encourages open collaboration.</p>
			
			<h2>0.2 WHY SHOULD YOU CARE?</h2>
			<p>Open source software gives you the freedom and control. We can be 
			independently examine and audit the software to check if the application 
			is spying/tracking on us, or even make our own versions of the same 
			software with/without the required features.

			It's the sense of transparency and the wholesome community collaboration which makes it worthwhile.
